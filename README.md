# My Project

This project is built using HTML. The styling was done with the help of Cursor AI.

AI is not a replacement for developers. It is a companion that helps speed up tasks, suggest improvements, and allows developers to focus on creativity and problem solving. In this project, Cursor AI assisted with styling while I wrote the HTML code.

## How to run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project folder
3. Launch index.html in your browser

## Acknowledgments
Thanks to Cursor AI for assisting with styling.
